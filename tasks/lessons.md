# Lessons Learned

## 2026-02-19

- User preference correction:
  - Pattern: user rejected a soft roadmap and wanted strict execution order with hard gates.
  - Rule: when presenting execution plans for this project, default to strict priority order, objective pass/fail gates, and explicit completion criteria.
  - Prevention: avoid time-boxed "soft" plans unless user asks for them explicitly.

- User expectation correction:
  - Pattern: user does not accept "gate complete" unless the gate is enforced in practice across the whole applicable surface (for UI: site-wide, not a small route sample).
  - Rule: when claiming a gate is complete, ensure enforcement scope matches user intent (full webapp coverage for site-wide gates).
  - Prevention: convert partial checks into explicit `core` vs `site-wide` gates and run both before reporting completion.

- User context correction:
  - Pattern: user intentionally deleted an older security-analysis file and asked to continue without treating it as an accidental repo issue.
  - Rule: when unexpected file removals appear, confirm user intent first and preserve intentional cleanup decisions while ensuring required tracked files remain intact.
  - Prevention: verify tracked-file state with `git ls-files` + `git status` before escalating a deletion as a blocker.
